# Script: git-delete-obsolete-branch.sh
# Description:
#   Manages deletion of local Git branches that no longer have 
#   corresponding remote tracking branches (gone branches).
#
#   Steps:
#     1. Fetches the latest remote branch information
#     2. Identifies branches with 'gone' remote tracking status
#     3. Lists found obsolete branches
#     4. Handles deletion based on specified mode:
#        - Interactive (default)
#        - Dry run
#        - Force delete
#
# Options:
#    --dry   Show branches that would be deleted without actually deleting
#    --yes   Delete branches without confirmation
#    -h      Show this help message
#
# Usage:
#   ./git-detele-obsolete-branch.sh              # Interactive mode
#   ./git-detele-obsolete-branch.sh --dry        # Show branches only
#   ./git-detele-obsolete-branch.sh --yes        # Delete without confirmation
#
# Notes:
#   - Requires git to be installed and configured
#   - Must be run from within a git repository
#   - Only deletes branches that can be safely deleted
